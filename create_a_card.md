# **Create a new Data card**

A Data Card is the simplest piece of content that can be exchanged on Askdata and it must be necessarily associated with a feed. <br />
In order to create a Card, we can proceed in two ways:

## Create it from Agent's Home 

If you have already created a feed, you can generate a new card by clicking **Create** and then **Data Card**:

</p>

Then you will be asked to enter the name and to select the feed to associate the card with (you can also create a new feed from this page).

</p>

When you are done just click **Add** and you are good to go!

## Create it from a feed

If you have already [created a feed](https://docs.askdata.com/docs/be-productive-with-feeds.html), you can simply add a new card by clicking **New Data Card** and customize it with your name.
